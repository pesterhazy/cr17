# "Creating Mobile Apps Interactively" - \<Paulus Esterhazy\>

**Format**: "Overview (5 minutes), Live Demo (30 minutes) and Questions (5 minutes)"

**Topics**: React Native, Boot React Native, Reagent, ClojureScript

Creative work requires immediate feedback, especially when you're building UI.
Boot React Native extends ClojureScript's reach, offering a way to build apps
for iOS and Android with a focus on short feedback cycles. In this demo, I'll
live-code a simple mobile game, starting from scratch. In the process, I'll
demonstrate how to use Reagent for live reloading and for styling React Native components.
